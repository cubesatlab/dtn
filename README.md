===

*The CubeSat Project at Vermont State University (formerly Vermont Technical College) has ended.
This repository is retained only for archival purposes. No further work on it is expected. No
pull requests will be accepted.*

This repository contains the CubeSat Laboratory's DTN implementation in SPARK. At the moment
this work is in an embryonic state. The repository only contains a partial (and largely
untested) CFDP implemenation. This repository is a placeholder for future work in this
area.
